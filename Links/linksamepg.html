		To link to a specific part of the same page use the id attribute (which can be used on every HTML element)<br />
		To link to an element that uses an id attribute you use the a element again, but the value of the href attribute starts with the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute.<br />
		To open link in new tab use target attribute.
